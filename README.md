# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

As current methods of deeply searching for an issue are time consuming, the most common way is to search manually. 
This project mainly focus on decreasing the time the researchers spend on doning repeat works.
Therefore, we proposed a tool to make the searching more effective.

Our tool is to find out the most related article among all the search results, and modify the sorting on the search engine.
We utilize several methods such as text similarity and keyword extraction to achieve our goal.

This tool is at a preliminary stage, which has a lot of things to improve.
